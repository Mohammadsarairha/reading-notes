# Open-source contributions

## What is Open Source?

In simple words, we can describe an open source project as source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a permissive license.

As an example to explain this, let's use a classroom scenario. A teacher can share a document on a platform like Goggle Docs. On this platform students can edit the document and even make copies of their own. But whenever they make edits they have to be approved by the teacher before reflecting on the document again.

That's how open source code works: once it's been made public, and you need to add a feature or make changes, the owner has to approve the added changes and publish them for others to see.

## Why you Should Contribute to Open-Source?

Contributing to open source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience.

There are plenty of reasons why you should contribute to an open source project, such as:

- To improve the software you rely on daily.
- To find a mentor if you need one.
- To learn new skills or improve on existing ones.
- To share your skills.
- To gain a much deeper knowledge about the software you're using.
- To build up your reputation and help grow your career.

## Improve Coding Skills

As with almost all professionals, the only way to truly learn and perfect your craft is to practice, practice, practice. However, few professions provide the means to practice on real projects. A mechanic, for example, can gain skills and experience by working on his own car or a friend’s, but won’t necessarily receive the valuable feedback from a seasoned mechanic needed to further develop his skills

## Gain Early Experience
Another motivation that is closely related to the first point is that OSS provides young developers with useful and valuable experience often required by companies for employment, even for internships and entry-level positions.

## Increase Community and Peer Recognition
Most people who are passionate about something strive to be recognized for the quality work they produce, and for some, developing software is a huge passion. Recognition from members from the OSS community not only encourages and motivates a developer to improve his or her skills, it can also create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events, etc.

## Greater Job Prospects
In the same way contributing to OSS can help you increase your chances of landing an internship, it can also improve your job and career prospects. Nowadays, when many tech companies receive a CV from a prospective developer, they usually skim over the sheets of paper and spend more time investigating the applicant’s Github account.

## Improve Software on a User and Business Level
A lot of the time, developers first come across OSS as users. In this case, the desire to contribute to this particular piece of OSS stems from wanting to improve it for their own use – either by improving certain areas or by developing new features and functionalities. The beauty of OSS compared to proprietary software is that this is all possible. Even if a user isn’t a programmer, he or she can still suggest new features and functionalities to the software’s owner or core team.

## Roles in a typical OS Project

In a typical OS project we will have the following people:

- Author - This is the person who created the project. They have the power to assign new roles to other members to help with the project's maintenance.
- Owner - The owner has administrative ownership of the project (and can be the same person as the author)
- Maintainers - These people are responsible for driving the vision and goals of the project. They're usually people who feel responsible for the direction of the project and who are committed to improving it.
- Contributors - Contributors add to the project in one way or another. They follow the same code review process, are subject to the same requirements on code style, and so on.
- Community Members/Users - These valuable members of the community can provide feedback about features, bug reports, and more.
