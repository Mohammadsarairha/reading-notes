# Ethics in Technology

## Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice

The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.

Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

## What is the definition of ethics in the workplace?

Ethics in the workplace is defined as the moral code that guides the behavior of employees with respect to what is right and wrong in regard to conduct and decision making. Ethical decision making in the workplace takes into account the individual employee’s best interest and also takes into account the best interest of those impacted. The latter of the definition is often where individual employees struggle to act ethically. Furthermore, ethical behavior doesn’t only apply to individual employees, the organization itself should exemplify standards of ethical conduct.

## Why is ethical behavior in the workplace important?

It is important to understand that ethical behavior in the workplace can stimulate positive employee behaviors that lead to organizational growth, just as unethical behavior in the workplace can inspire damaging headlines that lead to organizational demise.

Simply put, organizational stakeholders that include individuals, groups and organizations of various types enter into a relationship with a business organization for that business to protect their interests in a specific way. Therefore, there is a mutual expectation that stakeholders and business organizations act in an ethical manner and in each other’s best interest.


## What is technological ethics?

Ethics in technology, simply put, refers to moral principles that govern how technologies should be used. These principles include accountability, digital rights, privacy, freedom, data protection, online behaviour, and more. As new technologies become available, ethical issues are raised in an attempt to ensure that these have a positive impact on the human race and the environment.

## Why talk about it?

Last year, the Institute for the Future (IFTF) estimated that 85% of jobs that will exist in 2030 haven’t yet been invented. With the implementation of new technology comes an ethical duty, and it’s important that the generation who’ll be taking up these future jobs have a sound understanding of their ethical responsibilities.

Take hacking, for instance. Hacking has both negative and positive meanings, in that accessing a computer system without authorisation might be illegal, but it’s also a term used for remixing or testing new ways of using computers or programs. It’s important that young people have a good understanding of how and when it’s acceptable to hack, and when and where the line is crossed.


I’ve had the opportunity to work in tech companies of all sizes, from ambitious startups to major enterprises like Microsoft, Amazon and Groupon. In every case, I saw that the most successful tech companies shared a commonality: They are aligned organizations. Every day, they strive to ensure the whole company is crystal clear on three things: 

1. The mission, or purpose and scope, of their company’s existence  

2. The vision the organization wants to pursue

3. Behaviors of the people in the organization that get them to their vision  

Today, I’d like to focus on the third piece. Companies call their guiding behaviors
